# Pykep-Pork-Chop-Plot
This Python code has been adapted from https://gist.github.com/darioizzo/10643082#file-tutorial1-porkchopplots to easily produce approximate â–³V requirements for interplanetary trajectories using [link to PyKEP](https://github.com/esa/pykep), i.e. porkchop plots.

It uses the JPL Low Precision ephemerides data for planetary trajectories.
